# Problem description

> Given an array of numbers, we want to count how many items are greater than 5

## Logic to Solve the Problem (from origin)

- Given an array
- Go through all of the numbers
- For each number you compare if the number is greater than 5
- You increment a variable (letâ€™s call it count)
- You print the variable count after going through the array
